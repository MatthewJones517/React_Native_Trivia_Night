# React Native Trivia Night

For the past few years I've kinda become known as "The Flutter Guy" amongst my peers. With that said, there's no denying the market dominance of React Native. Since you can never know too many frameworks, I decided to give it a shot.

Hence "React Native Trivia Night" was born...

## But... Why?

I start every side project by looking for a weird API to use. In this case I discovered [jService](http://jservice.io/), which serves up 156,800 trivia questions that have been aired on Jeopardy over the years.

The final experience ended up being more compelling than I anticipated. I have had great fun annoying my wife by asking her random trivia throughout the development process.

## The Final Verdict

So where do I come down on the "Flutter vs. React Native" debate? Honestly? It's Coke vs. Pepsi. The thing that astounded me about this process was how similar they are in many respects. I really like them both for different reasons.

Thanks for taking a peek at this repo. Feel free to fork it and drop me a line if you have any questions!
